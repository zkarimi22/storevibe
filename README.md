## Getting Started

   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Production Deployment

1. Build the application
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the production server
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## How It Works

1. Users enter a Shopify store URL and select a vibe style (moodboard, city, or cover)
2. The app captures a screenshot of the store using Browserless.io
3. OpenAI's GPT-4o analyzes the screenshot and generates a text description
4. DALL-E 3 creates an image based on the description
5. The image is stored in Cloudinary and the result is saved in MongoDB
6. A permanent, shareable page is created with a SEO-friendly URL

## Rate Limiting

The application includes rate limiting to prevent abuse:
- 10 vibe generations per IP address per 24-hour period
